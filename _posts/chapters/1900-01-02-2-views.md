# Views

Now that we've gotten a project running, let's start putting things on the screen.

The "stuff" that's displayed in an app are called "views". A view can have many "subviews"; when you move a view, you also move its subviews. Subviews are also visually stacked on top of each other within their parent.

In code, these are `UIView` objects; everything you see on the screen is a descendent of `UIView`. They have a lot of nifty features, but what you should be concerned about right now is that they have:

1. A `frame` property, which contains a view's `x` and `y` coordinates and its `width` and `height` dimensions.
2. A `subviews` property, which is an array of all the view's subviews, sorted by back-to-front visibility (as in the index of a view in `subviews` is its "z-order").

A view's `frame` describes its shape and position relative to its parent view. That's a lot of words, so let me show you a quick example: imagine I have a view at (10, 10). I want a new subview of that view to appear at (50, 50) on the screen, so I have to set my new view's frame to be positioned at (40, 40). Make sense?

The base view of an app is the "window"; all other views are direct or descendent subviews of the window. Your app's window is a subclass of `UIView` called `UIWindow`.

Let's get to some code. In `AppDelegate`, change our `didFinishLaunching` method to look like:

```ruby
def application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions)
  # UIScreen describes the display our app is running on
  @window = UIWindow.alloc.initWithFrame(UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds)
  @window.makeKeyAndVisible

  @blue_view = UIView.alloc.initWithFrame(CGRectMake(10, 10, 100, 100))
  @blue_view.backgroundColor = UIColor.blueColor
  @window.addSubview(@blue_view)

  true
end
```

Let's walk this out. We create a `UIWindow` instance with the dimensions of the screen and do something called `makeKeyAndVisible`. This basically tells the OS that this window will be the one receiving touch events and that it should become visible on the screen. (if you're curious, you can have multiple windows on multiple screens, but let's take it one small step at a time).

So we create a window, then we create a new view and add it as a subview to the window. The view's frame is actually stored as a `CGRect` object, generated using `CGRectMake(x, y, w, h)`. BUT WATCH OUT! A `CGRect` is actually a composition of two objects: a `CGPoint` and `CGSize`. So if you want to read the y-coordinate or height of a view, you do `view.frame.position.y` or `view.frame.size.height`.

Also shown is `UIColor`, which is how we play with...colors. It has some obvious defaults (`blueColor`, `redColor`, etc), but can also be used to create arbitrary tints.

**FULL DISCLOSURE**: adding lone `UIView`s directly to the `UIWindow` is generally not a great idea and is frowned upon, but it's a nice way to learn. So don't do it in production code.

Run our app (just `rake`, remember?) and observe our...blue box.

Let's make it more exciting by...adding more boxes! Like so:

```ruby
  ...
  @blue_view = UIView.alloc.initWithFrame(CGRectMake(10, 10, 100, 100))
  @blue_view.backgroundColor = UIColor.blueColor
  @window.addSubview(@blue_view)

  @green_view = UIView.alloc.initWithFrame(CGRectMake(30, 30, 40, 40))
  @green_view.backgroundColor = UIColor.greenColor
  @window.addSubview(@green_view)

  @red_view  = UIView.alloc.initWithFrame(CGRectMake(30, 30, 40, 40))
  @red_view.backgroundColor = UIColor.redColor
  # NOTE: *not* adding to @window
  @blue_view.addSubview(@red_view)
  ...
```

`rake` again and a-ha! See how the red view is further down than the green view, despite seemingly identical `frame`s?

Just for fun, let's play with our interactive `REPL`. The terminal where you ran `rake` should be displaying an `irb`-esque prompt while the simulator is open. Let's dig around and find our `@blue_view`:

```ruby
> delegate = UIApplication.sharedApplication.delegate
=> #<AppDelegate>
> blue_view = delegate.instance_variable_get('@blue_view')
=> #<UIView>
```

What did we do there? Well `UIApplication.sharedApplication` gives us the object the system uses to describe our application. There will only ever be one of these. Like I said earlier, it's been configured to use our delegate, which is found (conveniently, I know) with `.delegate`. Once we grab that, we simply use the nifty `instance_variable_get` to retrieve our view.

We can confirm that the view has one subview with `blue_view.subviews.count`. Let's grab our `red_view` and do something maniacal: remove it.

```ruby
> blue_view.subviews.count
=> 1
> red_view = blue_view.subviews[0]
=> #<UIView>
> red_view.removeFromSuperview
=> #<UIView>
```

"Whoa" there Neo, it disappeared. The `removeFromSuperview` method is how a view can remove itself from the screen and it's parent view's `subviews` (you can confirm this by checking `blue_view.subviews.count` again).

## Wrap Up

This wasn't a very lengthy example, but it covers the core concepts of views: they have frames and they have subviews. This was simple, but as you'll see they get much more complicated. Thus, we need some better infrastructure for dealing with them.

Let's recap:

- Everything on the screen is a `UIView`.
- The base view of your app is an instance of `UIWIndow`, of which everything is a child or descendent view. Create this in your delegate.
- Views have subviews, added with `UIView#addSubview`. Successive subviews stack on top of each other visually.
