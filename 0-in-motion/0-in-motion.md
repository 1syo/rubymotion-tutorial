# In Motion

You want to make iOS apps. It might be for your job, the focus of your startup, a school project, or just something you want to spend a weekend on. So you do a quick google and find out you write iOS apps in a reasonably esoteric language called Objective-C[1]. That could be a bummer.

Then one day, along comes this thing called RubyMotion. It lets you write iOS apps in Ruby, which is not as uncommon.
